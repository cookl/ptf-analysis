/// Analysis of PTF data
///
/// Definitions of terminology used, and associated structures:
///
/// Each input root file has a number of "ScanPoint" events, where each event has
/// several waveforms at a given location.
///
/// class  MeanRMSCalc           For calculating mean and rms
///
/// class  PTFErrorBarAnalysis   For calculating the error bar size to use on the waveforms
///
/// struct WaveformFitResult     Structure to hold one waveform fit result
///
/// class  ScanPoint             Holds location of scan point, first entry number in TTree of scan point, and number of waveforms
///
/// class  PTFAnalysis           For doing analysis of all of the waveforms, and keep track of scan points, store results in TTree
///
///
/// This program takes a PTF scan root file as input.
/// The analysis proceeds in these steps:
/// 1. Determine the uncertainties on the "collected charge" by studying the pedestal
///    of the waveforms in bins 1-20.  This part of the analysis produces two kinds of
///    pedestal histograms.
/// 2. Fit the waveforms to gaussians.  Each waveform is read in once into a Waveform object,
///    it is then fit to a gaussian using a fitter.  Fit results are stored in a TTee that
///    has one entry per scan-point
/// 3. The now filled TTree of fitted waveform parameters is analyzed to make histograms
///
